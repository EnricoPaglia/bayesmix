bayesmix is a C++ library for running MCMC simulation in Bayesian mixture models.

Current state of the software:
- bayesmix performs inference for mixture models of the kind

Where P is either the Dirichlet process or the Pitman--Yor process.

- We currently support univariate and multivariate location-scale mixture of Gaussian densities

- Inference is carried out using either Algorithm 2 or Algorithm 8 in [Neal (2000)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/npbayes/papers/neal_sampling.pdf).

- Serialization of the MCMC chains is possible using [Google's protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)


## Installation:

Just clone the repository

## Future steps (contributors are welcome!)

A Python package is already under development

- Extension to normalized random measures
- Using HMC / MALA MCMC algorithm to sample from the cluster-specific full conditionals when it's not conjugate to the base measure
- R package
